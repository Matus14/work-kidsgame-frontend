## Kids Math Game – Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Kids Math Game – a fun and educational math quiz for children that helps them practice addition (for now) while tracking scores, performance, and leaderboard rankings. The application is built using React and powered by a RESTful backend implemented in Spring Boot.

The project is still in development. I am currently working on additional functionalities, with the goal of creating a working application for my younger cousins to help them learn basic math operations.

Updates will be released once the features are fully tested and stable.


## Features

- Random math questions (addition only)
- Player name input
- Answer validation with feedback
- Quiz summary (correct, incorrect, score)
- Leaderboard (top scores from backend)
